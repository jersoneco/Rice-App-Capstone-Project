WATER MANAGEMENT
    Water helps in field operations, biological processes, dissolving soil nutrients, and regulating temperature. The study and practice of appropriate application of water to the soil for the development of lucrative crops such as rice is known as water management. It improves weed management, helps rice plants utilize soil nutrients efficiently, and influences farm operations.


Avoid excessive water or drought stress
    Water assists rice transmit “food”, regulate its temperature, and facilitate physico-chemical processes and gas exchange.

    Excessive water during the vegetative stage lowers tillers and leaf area, as well as discolors the roots; drought causes leaf-rolling, leaf tip-drying, and stunted development. Drought stress can induce leaf-rolling and drying, short panicles, and numerous empty grains during panicle initiation and grain filling.

    Accordingly, from early tillering until 2 weeks before crop maturity or harvest, keep irrigation water at a depth of 3-5cm. Drain 1 week before harvest for medium-textured soil or during the dry season. Drain 2 weeks before harvest for fine-textured soil or during the rainy season.
