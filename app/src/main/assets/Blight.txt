        Bacterial blight first becomes evident as water-soaked streaks that spread from the leaf tips and margins, becoming larger and eventually releasing a milky ooze that dries into yellow droplets. Characteristic grayish white lesions then appear on the leaves, signaling the late stages of infection, when leaves dry out and die.

CAUSE
        Bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.

SYMPTOMS
        Form larger yellowish lesions with uneven edges.

SOLUTION
        Triazole and strobilurin fungicides.
